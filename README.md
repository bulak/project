# projects

Simple project management for bash CLI as a soft 
wrapper for terminal multiplexers (tmux or screen).

## Features

save or kill projects from CLI. `projects` will remember
paths, layouts, histories for you
- Eternal bash history. Keep ALL your bash history, also
separately for each project with time and full path stamps
- Journaling. Keep notes per project simply from CLI
